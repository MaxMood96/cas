  description: "Whether service registry events should be streamed and published across\
    \ a CAS cluster. One typical workflow is to enable the publisher on one master\
    \ node and have others consume definitions and changes from the upstream master\
    \ node in order to avoid overrides and timing issues as changes may step over\
    \ each other if the service registry schedule is not timed correctly."
